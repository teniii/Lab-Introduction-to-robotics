# SafeBox - Final Project

### Intructions
First of all, you need to plug it in. Once done that, press any button and the box will be activated, signaling this by 4 beeps.
The rules are simple. The password consists in a combination of 4 pushes of buttons. Once a sequence is inserted, if it's correct, the box will open and a audio signal will be heard. If it's not correct, the buzzer will announce the user how many attempts he is left with. Once all the attempts are used and the box is still locked, the alarm will start. After 8 seconds the alarm stops and the procces is repeated.
