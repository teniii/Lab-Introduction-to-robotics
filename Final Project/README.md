# SafeBox - Final Project

### Intructions
First of all, you need to plug it in. Once done that, press any button and the box will be activated, signaling this by 4 beeps.
The rules are simple. The password consists in a combination of 4 pushes of buttons. Once a sequence is inserted, if it's correct, the box will open and a audio signal will be heard. If it's not correct, the buzzer will announce the user how many attempts he is left with. Once all the attempts are used and the box is still locked, the alarm will start. After 8 seconds the alarm stops and the procces repeats.
Once opened, you can acces the valuable things inside of it. After the robotics event held in the main hall of the faculty, I've found a big problem with the passcode. If someone sees you inserting the code, they can memorize it and steal all your things. So, once the box is open, you have to insert a new passcode. When you finished, close the box and lock it by pressing any button. Keep in mind that the new passcode has to be the same length as the previous one.

### Components
Inside the box you can find a breadboard with a condenser and a buzzer, the arduino and a servo, leaving all the other space for storage. The locking system is a pretty simple one: we have on the top a servo and o the side near the servo an L-shaped metal piece. Once the box is closed and we are locking it, the propeller of the motor is blocked by the metal piece to go up.
