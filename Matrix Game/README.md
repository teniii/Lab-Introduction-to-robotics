# Matrix Game - Connect Dots


### Description
In the game you have to connect 4 dots vertically, horizontally or 
obliquely before your opponent does it. For that, each player is going to
use a joystick. For the toggling in the menu, just one of the joysticks
will work. When the playing session is over, you choose the option in the menu 
and if the number of games won by one of the players is bigger 
than the highscore stored in EEPROM, the highscore will be updated. 
You have two levels of difficulty, easy and hard. For the adventurers that 
try the hard mode, it will be a timer involved and a buzzer that will put 
them under pressure.
Depending on the level, the score will be calculated accordingly. 
In the menu you can start the game, end it,see general info, see the highscore
